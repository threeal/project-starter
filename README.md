# Project Starter

A minimalist template for starting a new project on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

This template provides a basic setup for a new GitHub project, including a default `.gitignore` file, [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) configuration, and sample [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows.

## Usage

This guide explains how to use this template to start a new project.

### Create a New Project

Follow [this link](https://github.com/new?template_name=project-starter&template_owner=threeal) to create a new project based on this template. For more information about creating a repository from a template on GitHub, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Alternatively, you can clone this repository locally to begin using this template.

### Choose a License

By default, this template is [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/). Before modifying this template, replace the [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file with the license you want to use for the new project. For more information about licensing a repository, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).

Alternatively, you can remove the `LICENSE` file or leave it as-is to keep the new project unlicensed.

### Update the README File

Update the content of this [`README.md`](./README.md) file with a description of the new project. For more information on adding READMEs to a project, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

### What's Next?

Next, you can populate the new project with your content. Be sure to update the [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore) file, [`.dependabot.yaml`](./.github/dependabot.yaml) file, and [workflow files](./.github/workflows) according to your project requirements. If you're new to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or GitHub, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) for more information.
