The Project Starter is a [GitHub repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that provides a minimalistic boilerplate to kickstart any type of project on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Use this template to initialize your project with preconfigured settings recommended for various GitHub projects.
